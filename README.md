# ScrapingPreformattedTextFromGovWebpage
Condensed the logic from UIKit working app to get the Lower Mississippi River Gauge data from the text only government webpage into a playground.
With this I wish to code the UIKit app into a SwiftUI app. 
This is an intermediate step in the development conversion.
